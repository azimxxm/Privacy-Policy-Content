Privacy Policy
Effective Date: Januar 1, 2026

StorageZen ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our mobile application ("App").

1. Overview
StorageZen is designed with privacy as a core principle. We do not collect, store, share, or sell your personal data. All processing of your photos, videos, and contacts happens locally on your device.

2. Data We Access
To provide the App's functionality, we request access to certain data on your device. This data is never uploaded to our servers or any third-party servers.

2.1 Photo Library
We ask for access to your Photo Library to:

Identify similar photos and duplicates.
Find large files, screenshots, and live photos.
Allow you to delete unwanted items to free up space.
Data Handling: All analysis algorithms run directly on your iPhone. Your photos and videos never leave your device.

2.2 Contacts
We ask for access to your Contacts to:

Identify and merge duplicate contacts.
Find contacts with missing information (no name, no number).
Create backups of your contact list.
Data Handling: Your contact data is processed locally. Backups are stored in your device's local filesystem or your personal iCloud Drive (if you choose to save them there), not on our servers.

3. Third-Party Services
We do not use any third-party analytics services (such as Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or Firebase) to track user behavior or collecting personal information.

We use the following open-source libraries for UI and utility purposes only, which do not collect user data:

Lottie: For rendering animations.
Kingfisher: For efficient image handling.
4. Internet Access
The App functions entirely offline. Internet access may only be used for:

Verifying App Store subscriptions (handled directly by Apple).
Opening external links you tap on (e.g., Support, Rate App).
5. Security
Because we do not collect your data, we do not have a database to secure. Your data remains as secure as your device itself, protected by Apple's iOS security sandboxing.

6. Children’s Privacy
Our App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Since we do not collect any user data, this applies to users of all ages.

7. Changes to This Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top.
